# Classic-arcade-game(Frogger)

This is a project from the Udacity Front-End developer nanodegree.

## Game Concept

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How To Play:
Player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard.
